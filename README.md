# Simple Python script for downloading data from NASA Earthdata servers

The start to this script was obtained at [https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/EL/How+To+Access+Data+With+Python].

A file `.earthdata_get_data.ini` is expected to be in the user's home
directory.  This file contains the user name and password for accessing
Earthdata.
